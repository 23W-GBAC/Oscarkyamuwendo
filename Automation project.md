## **PROBLEM 1: OVER REPEATION OF WRITING FILE PATHS**
   I had a problem of writing file paths which some consisted of long filenames like repositories and this could make me take long time to access a file in a sub folder from other many sub folders 


## SOLUTION
I had to initiate auto completion of file names on my terminal on my mac


### STEP 1: Install a shell and one them is ZSH SHELL
To install Zsh (Z Shell), you can follow these general steps. The process might vary slightly depending on 
     your operating system.

- **For Linux: Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:**
		Open a terminal.

**Run the following command to install Zsh:**

		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install zsh
	
After installation, you can start Zsh by typing zsh and pressing Enter.

	
- **For macOS:**
Zsh is pre-installed on macOS. You can check the installed version by typing zsh --version in the terminal.

      To start Zsh, simply type zsh and press Enter.

- **For Windows:**
Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
If you don't have WSL installed, follow the instructions on the official Microsoft documentation to set up WSL.

Open the terminal in your WSL instance.

Run the following command to install Zsh:

	bash
		Copy code
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install zsh
After installation, you can start Zsh by typing zsh and pressing Enter.


During the installation process, make sure to select the zsh package from the package list.

After installation, you can start Zsh by running the Cygwin terminal and typing zsh and pressing Enter.

**Customization (Optional):**
	Once Zsh is installed, you may want to customize it further using frameworks like Oh My Zsh or Prezto.
        These frameworks provide additional features, themes, and plugins. You can find installation instructions 
	on their respective GitHub repositories:

	Oh My Zsh
	Prezto
Keep in mind that the installation steps may change, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official documentation 							or the respective GitHub repositories for the most up-to-date information.

### STEP 2. Install command: (this l did by running the command below on my terminal)
	For Mac
	brew install zsh-autosuggestions

### STEP 3. Activating the auto suggestions
      
	To activate the autosuggestions,l added the following at the end of your .zshrc
	to open .zshrc type vim .zshrc in your terminal

       source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh

### STEP 4. Final step
At last l closed the terminal and opened it again then next was magic happening on my termminal where l got suggestipns of 						commands which had written before and this helped me to save time l would spend on typing

 ## PROBLEM: ADDITION OF TEXT IN BLOG CONSECUTIVELY WITH USE OF THE TERMINAL
I had to add text in my blog several times but without updating it daily my main blog at the github account

## SOLUTION
  	I used VIM as a tool to help me edit text in my blog and save it locally on my machine several times using 
        the terminal and then push it once on github 
### STEP 1
        I had to first have home brew on my mac and then install then vim respectively following the commands below
	Open Terminal (you can find it using Spotlight with Cmd + Space and typing "Terminal").

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command:

      bash
	 "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Vim with the following command:

### STEP 2
	bash
	Copy code
	brew install vim
After the installation is complete, you can run Vim by typing vim in the Terminal.

 ## PROBLEM: UPDATING OF CONTENT IN THE LOCAL REPOSITORY TO THE REPOSITORY ON GITHUB
I encountered a challenge with laptop when trying to add/update text on github from my local repostory  ussing the terminal.

## SOLUTION
  	
In summary,l discovered that l had to first create a public key locally on my machine and then add it to among the keys on github so that l can access to add, edit/update and push my content to github 


### STEP 1 ( How l created a public key)


To create a public key using the terminal, you can use the ssh-keygen command. Here are the steps:

**Open your terminal.**

Use the following command to generate a new SSH key pair. You will be prompted to provide a location for the key and an optional passphrase.

	bash
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

**Explanation of options:**

	-t rsa: Specifies the type of key to create (RSA).
	-b 4096: Specifies the number of bits in the key (4096 bits is recommended for stronger security).
	-C "your_email@example.com": Adds a label/comment to the key, typically your email address.
Press Enter to accept the default file location (usually ~/.ssh/id_rsa) or provide a custom path.

If you want to add a passphrase for extra security, enter a passphrase when prompted. You can also leave it blank if you don't want a passphrase.

**Note:** Even if you leave it blank, it's generally a good idea to use a passphrase for added security.

Once the key pair is generated, you'll see a message indicating the location of the public and private keys.

	vbnet
	
	Your public key has been saved in /path/to/your/home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	Your private key has been saved in /path/to/your/home/.ssh/id_rsa.

Now you have successfully created an SSH key pair. The public key is stored in the file with the .pub extension (e.g., id_rsa.pub). You can share this public key with services like GitHub, GitLab, or others where you need to authenticate using SSH keys. The private key (id_rsa) should be kept secure and not shared.

**To display the content of your public key, you can use the following command:**

	bash
	
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the output and use it wherever you need to add your public key.


### **STEP 2 ( In this step, l got a copy of the repostory onto my computer by carrying ou git clone)**


To clone a repository from GitHub (or any Git repository) using the terminal, follow these steps:

**Open your terminal.**

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:

	bash
	
	cd /path/to/destination/directory
Get the clone URL from the GitHub repository, but it is better to use SSH URL

**If you are using SSH, you can use the SSH URL:**

	bash
	
	git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
 
 ### **STEP 3 ( This is a step where we now send/update our content to the github account )**

 To send content from a cloned repository to GitHub, you'll typically follow these steps:

**Navigate to the Local Repository:**
Open your terminal and navigate to the local directory of the cloned Git repository.

	bash
	
	cd /path/to/cloned/repository
	Check the Status:
It's a good practice to check the status of your local repository to see which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

	bash
	
	git status
	Add and Commit Changes:
If you've made changes to your files, add them to the staging area and commit the changes:

	bash
	
	git add .
	git commit -m "Your commit message here"
	Push Changes to GitHub:

Finally, push your changes to the GitHub repository. If you cloned the repository using HTTPS, you might be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.

	bash

	git push origin master
 Then you are able to find your content on git hub
