 ## **PROBLEM: ADDING TEXT TO MY BLOG REGULARLY USING THE TERMINAL.**
I often needed to add text to my blog, but I didn't update my main GitHub blog daily.

## SOLUTION.
  	I used VIM as a tool to help me edit text in my blog and save it locally on my machine several times using 
        the terminal and then push it once on github 
### STEP 1
        I had to first have home brew on my mac and then install then vim respectively following the commands below
	Open Terminal (you can find it using Spotlight with Cmd + Space and typing "Terminal").

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command:

      bash
	 "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Vim with the following command:

### STEP 2
	bash
	Copy code
	brew install vim
After the installation is complete, you can run Vim by typing vim in the Terminal.
