## **PROBLEM: ENGAGING OTHER DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS AND ADVICE THROUGH PULL REQUESTS AND FORKS.**
    This is my last post, it is not by a mistake because indeed it has not been that simple for me to establish pull requests so that other developers can engage and comment about my content,\
    l indeed though its just a simple thing but the best part of the story is that i was finnaly able to fix it. 
## SOLUTION
  	
    In my research, l found this information helpful as it helped me come up with all the process of make pull requests to contribute to my fellow developers' content
    Creating a pull request on GitHub is a collaborative way to propose changes to a codebase. It allows other developers to review your changes and provide feedback before merging them into the main branch of the repository. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a pull request on GitHub:

## STEP 1: FORK THE REPOSITORY:

    If you're contributing to an existing project, you'll need to fork the repository first. Forking creates a copy of the repository under your own account, allowing you to work on your changes without affecting the original repository.

    Make your changes: Clone your forked repository to your local machine and make the changes you want to contribute. Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them and push them to your forked repository.

## STEP 2: CREATING THE PULL REQUEST:

    Navigate to the repository: Open GitHub and go to the main page of the repository you want to contribute to.

## STEP 3: SELECT THE BRANCH:
    On the repository page, in the "Branches" section, choose the branch containing your commits. This is typically the branch you worked on (e.g., "feature-branch").

    Initiate the pull request: Above the file list, in the yellow banner, click the "Compare & pull request" button.

## STEP 4:SELECT BASE AND COMPARE BRANCHES:
    In the pull request creation dialog, choose the "base branch" as the main branch of the original repository where you want to merge your changes (e.g., "master"). Then, select the "compare branch" as the branch containing your commits.

    Provide a title and description: Enter a clear and concise title for your pull request, summarizing the purpose of your changes. In the description, provide a more detailed explanation of your changes, why they were made, and any relevant context.


## STEP 5: CREATING THE PULL REQUEST:
   Once you're satisfied with the title, description, and diff review, click the "Create pull request" button
