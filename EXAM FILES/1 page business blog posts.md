### TOPIC: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
### WHY: 
Artificial Intelligence is one of the trending technology in all most all fields such as health,social, economicial, financial etc, on my side am passionate about technology and this elevetes to my dreams.
### POST 1. AUTOMATION IN THE HUMAN BODY AS A SIGNIFACANT LEAD TO ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE
Automation in the context of the human body typically refers to the natural and involuntary processes that occur without conscious control. Here are some examples of automation in the human body:
- Autonomic Nervous System (ANS): The ANS regulates involuntary bodily functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, respiratory rate, and pupillary response. 
- Endocrine System: Hormones are chemical messengers produced by glands in the endocrine system. They regulate various physiological functions,
- Respiratory System: Breathing is an automatic process controlled by the respiratory center in the brainstem. 
#### In summary ( matching bodily parts' finctions with that for machines)
1. Sight, taste, smell, touch - Vision, pressure, temperature, flow, photoelectric, inductive, capacitive, position/distance measurement sensors
2. Listening/reading - Vibration sensors, RFID tag readers
3. Nervous system - control network, cables, connectors
4. Brain - Controller, PLC
5. Muscles - Valves, drives, motors
6. Voice - audio signaling devices, numerical output devices (RFID data to tag)
7. Body language (visual signals) â€“ stack lights, display screens, indicator lights, panel meters
### POST 2. THREATS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE
(AI) continues to advance, there are several potential threats and challenges that may arise in the future. It's important to note that while AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits, it also raises ethical, societal, and security concerns. Here are some key areas of concern:
Job Displacement ,Privacy Concerns, Bias and Fairness, Security Risks                                                                          
### POST 3. WHAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE CAN'T DO?
- Counselling
- Music performance and main in the main blog
### Conclusion
In conclusion, Artificial intelligence has proved to be make tasks efficient, so it important to consider and work ethically towards Articificial inttelligence and this includes thouroughly testing of all AI models before taken tothe public
